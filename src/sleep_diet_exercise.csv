"While most people know that diet and exercise are two important ways to improve their health, sleep is often overlooked. Sleep hygiene, which involves recommendations that promote quality sleep, are a good place to start if you’re looking to improve your sleep. Here are some tips for improving your sleep hygiene through diet and exercise:

Don’t eat too late: Be sure to give your body time to digest after eating large meals. Try having dinner earlier in the evening.
Avoid caffeine: Beware of stimulants like coffee, energy drinks, and soda. If you do consume these, try to limit them to early in the day. If you find yourself drinking a lot of caffeine during the day, ask yourself if you’re making up for excessive daytime sleepiness.
Move your body: Schedule regular exercise to improve your sleep. While any movement during the daytime is good, it’s even better to get regular, moderate exercise a few days a week. Try to avoid working out too close to bedtime, giving your body a few hours after working out to wind down before bed.
Get some light: Try exercising outdoors, as exposure to natural light during the day can help keep your body in sync with its natural sleep rhythms."
"(CNN)The White House is hammering out the details of an increasingly likely European summit between President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which could happen as soon as early summer, according to sources familiar with the planning.

The planning comes as the Biden administration is preparing to send Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Ukraine next month, according to a Ukrainian government source close to the ongoing negotiations.
The visit could ease the European country's anxiety over a potential meeting between Biden and Putin this summer on the heels of the US President's meetings with Group of 7 and NATO allies. The fact that the Biden administration would deploy its most senior diplomat to Ukraine in the weeks before a potential summit sends a clear signal that Washington stands with the Eastern European nation and values it as an ally."
"Washington (CNN)For the last 100 days, President Joe Biden and his top advisers have mounted an urgent, wartime effort to get millions of coronavirus vaccines into the arms of Americans in order to beat back a pandemic that has upended the world for the better part of year.

The effort, described to CNN during in-depth interviews with three of the administration's top Covid advisers and two other White House officials, has allowed the US to go from having one of the worst Covid responses in the world to being a global leader in getting shots in arms. The interviews reveal how the Biden team inherited a pandemic at its zenith with a high demand for vaccines and little supply, along with no long-term plan to vaccinate millions of Americans. The President, at times impatient, pressed his advisers harder on ways to improve the federal government's response to the virus."
"In April, the Food and Drug Administration and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended temporarily pausing use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after rare, one-in-a-million, cases of blood clots were found. The Biden team insisted this would not affect their supply or vaccination targets, and the vaccine is now back in use. But the pause did cause some initial confusion, and there were worries that it may increase vaccine hesitancy among those who were already unsure."
"But the country is now at a tipping point. With vaccine supply secured, it's now set to outpace demand at a critical moment, with Covid-19 variants on the rise. And the Biden administration's success or failure in reaching the hesitant and convincing everyone to take the vaccine will be critical in determining whether the country can finally win the war against the virus and move forward.
The administration insisted it would always lead with the science, but the science has often moved too slowly for a public eager to get back to normal. Some critics have said the Biden team should have put out earlier guidance about travel and socializing after vaccination, as an incentive to get the shot."
"Although a substantial body of literature has explored the relationship between sleep and exercise, comprehensive reviews and definitive conclusions about the impact of exercise interventions on sleep are lacking. Electronic databases were searched for articles published between January 2013 and March 2017. Studies were included if they possessed either objective or subjective measures of sleep and an exercise intervention that followed the guidelines recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine. Thirty-four studies met these inclusion criteria. Twenty-nine studies concluded that exercise improved sleep quality or duration; however, four found no difference and one reported a negative impact of exercise on sleep. Study results varied most significantly due to participants' age, health status, and the mode and intensity of exercise intervention. Mixed findings were reported for children, adolescents, and young adults. Interventions conducted with middle-aged and elderly adults reported more robust results. In these cases, exercise promoted increased sleep efficiency and duration regardless of the mode and intensity of activity, especially in populations suffering from disease. Our review suggests that sleep and exercise exert substantial positive effects on one another; however, to reach a true consensus, the mechanisms behind these observations must first be elucidated."
"Presently in American society, an inability to sleep and sleep well is a pervasive health concern. Despite the magnitude of this problem, the physiological function of sleep in regulating normal hormonal and metabolic processes is not fully recognized. However, that does not dismiss the mounting evidence that physical exercise is an effective intervention for those who do not experience adequate sleep quantity or quality. This review summarizes some of the findings as they apply to Americans throughout the lifespan and some of the special conditions in which the sleep-exercise interaction is critical. Further research needs to explore the biological mechanisms that modulate the dynamic interplay between these two aspects of human lifestyle."
"Sleeping well directly affects your mental and physical health. Fall short and it can take a serious toll on your daytime energy, productivity, emotional balance, and even your weight. Yet many of us regularly toss and turn at night, struggling to get the sleep we need.

Getting a good night’s sleep may seem like an impossible goal when you’re wide awake at 3 a.m., but you have much more control over the quality of your sleep than you probably realize. Just as the way you feel during your waking hours often hinges on how well you sleep at night, so the cure for sleep difficulties can often be found in your daily routine.

Unhealthy daytime habits and lifestyle choices can leave you tossing and turning at night and adversely affect your mood, brain and heart health, immune system, creativity, vitality, and weight. But by experimenting with the following tips, you can enjoy better sleep at night, boost your health, and improve how you think and feel during the day."
"Do you often find yourself unable to get to sleep or regularly waking up night after night? Residual stress, worry, and anger from your day can make it very difficult to sleep well. Taking steps to manage your overall stress levels and learning how to curb the worry habit can make it easier to unwind at night. You can also try developing a relaxing bedtime ritual to help you prepare your mind for sleep, such as practicing a relaxation technique, taking a warm bath, or dimming the lights and listening to soft music or an audiobook.

Problems clearing your head at night can also stem from your daytime habits. The more overstimulated your brain becomes during the day, the harder it can be to slow down and unwind at night. Maybe, like many of us, you’re constantly interrupting tasks during the day to check your phone, email, or social media. Then when it comes to getting to sleep at night, your brain is so accustomed to seeking fresh stimulation, it becomes difficult to unwind.

Help yourself by setting aside specific times during the day for checking your phone and social media and, as much as possible, try to focus on one task at a time. You’ll be better able to calm your mind at bedtime."
"Sleep and mental health are closely connected. Sleep deprivation affects your psychological state and mental health. And those with mental health problems are more likely to have insomnia or other sleep disorders.

Americans are notoriously sleep deprived, but those with psychiatric conditions are even more likely to be yawning or groggy during the day. Chronic sleep problems affect 50% to 80% of patients in a typical psychiatric practice, compared with 10% to 18% of adults in the general U.S. population. Sleep problems are particularly common in patients with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Traditionally, clinicians treating patients with psychiatric disorders have viewed insomnia and other sleep disorders as symptoms. But studies in both adults and children suggest that sleep problems may raise risk for, and even directly contribute to, the development of some psychiatric disorders. This research has clinical application, because treating a sleep disorder may also help alleviate symptoms of a co-occurring mental health problem.

The brain basis of a mutual relationship between sleep and mental health is not yet completely understood. But neuroimaging and neurochemistry studies suggest that a good night's sleep helps foster both mental and emotional resilience, while chronic sleep deprivation sets the stage for negative thinking and emotional vulnerability."
"Sleep is essential for a person’s health and wellbeing, according to the National Sleep Foundation (NSF). Yet millions of people do not get enough sleep and many suffer from lack of sleep. For example, surveys conducted by the NSF (1999-2004) reveal that at least 40 million Americans suffer from over 70 different sleep disorders and 60 percent of adults report having sleep problems a few nights a week or more. Most of those with these problems go undiagnosed and untreated. In addition, more than 40 percent of adults experience daytime sleepiness severe enough to interfere with their daily activities at least a few days each month — with 20 percent reporting problem sleepiness a few days a week or more. Furthermore, 69 percent of children experience one or more sleep problems a few nights or more during a week."
"(CNN)While President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats are readying their plan to hike incomes taxes on the wealthy, a new government report shows that their $1.9 trillion relief package slashed taxes for lower- and moderate-income Americans for this year.

Taxpayers earning less than $75,000 annually will pay no tax, on average, in 2021, thanks to a multitude of provisions in the American Rescue Plan, which Biden signed into law last month. Instead, lower-income Americans can expect to receive hefty refunds -- though, of course, that will vary depending on every individual's finances.
Those with incomes between $75,000 and $100,000 a year will pay an average tax rate of just 1.8%, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, a non-partisan group that assists Congress with tax legislation.
This is a far bigger tax cut for Americans on the lower and middle rungs of the income ladder than the reductions contained in the Republicans' Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017."
"The latest coronavirus relief package was geared to help the less fortunate, who have been hit hardest by the pandemic.
The bottom 20% of taxpayers will receive a 20.4% boost in after-tax income and a $2,850 reduction in federal taxes, on average, from the relief law, according to the Tax Policy Center. The next group will see a 9.3% increase in after-tax income and $3,260 decline in federal taxes.
However, the top 20% will experience only a 0.7% bump in after-tax income and a $1,900 decrease in tax levy, with the top 1% seeing essentially no change.
By contrast, the Republicans' tax cuts heavily benefited wealthier Americans. The top 20% and the top 1% both received a 2.2% boost in after-tax income and saw their federal tax bills decline by nearly $5,800 and by $32,650, respectively, the Tax Policy Center found.
Meanwhile, the lowest 20% received only a 0.3% bump in after-tax income and a $40 break in federal taxes. The second quintile got a 1% income boost and a $320 reduction in their tax bill.
Biden is calling for future tax increases on the wealthy to finance his family plan, expected to be unveiled this week. But it's uncertain whether those proposals will pass Congress."
"(CNN)There has been a major coronavirus outbreak among US diplomatic staff in India with two locally employed staff dying and more than 100 people testing positive in recent weeks as the country struggles to cope with a dramatic surge of the deadly disease, two sources familiar with the situation told CNN.

Reported Covid-19 case rates in India have hit global highs for the past five consecutive days, hospitals have run out of beds, medicine, ventilators and oxygen, and thousands have died amid a devastating second wave, which began last month.
The sources did not provide details where in the country the staff died and tested positive but the US operates five consulates in different cities and an embassy in the capital of New Delhi.
US personnel, family members and locally employed staff in India only began receiving their Covid vaccines within the past two weeks, one of the sources said. Within the past six weeks -- even as India's case rates were ticking up and staff had not yet been vaccinated -- there were two high-level trips by Biden administration officials to the country."
"On Monday, the US Consulate in Chennai said in a tweet that, ""Considering current COVID-19 conditions, all routine services at @USAndChennai are canceled from April 26 through May 15th, including all routine non-immigrant visa interview appointments, interview waiver appointments, and routine American Citizen Services appointments."" The Embassy in New Delhi said Friday that ""in-person visa appointments and interview-waiver appointments are cancelled from April 26 -- May 9 in light of current pandemic conditions."" On April 9, the consulate in Mumbai said it would ""provide only essential consular services until further notice.""
As yet the United States has not provided India with coronavirus vaccines to help combat the outbreak in the country. On Monday. President Joe Biden spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""committing that the United States and India will work closely together in the fight against COVID-19,"" according to a White House readout.
""The President pledged America's steadfast support for the people of India who have been impacted by the recent surge in COVID-19 cases,"" the readout said. ""In response, the United States is providing a range of emergency assistance, including oxygen-related supplies, vaccine materials, and therapeutics."""
"Ahead of his first address to Congress on Wednesday, the President will give remarks on the state of the pandemic on Tuesday. The three people familiar with the expected announcement said Biden will announce new CDC guidance on whether vaccinated people need to wear masks outdoors, though the final language of the expected announcement is still unclear.
One of Biden's top coronavirus advisers, Dr. Anthony Fauci, strongly hinted that the guidance would be updated this week, telling CNN's Jim Acosta Sunday he didn't want to get ahead of the CDC, but they ""will be coming out with updating their guidelines of what people who are vaccinated can do and even some who are not vaccinated.""
A November review in the Journal of Infectious Diseases found that the odds of viral transmission are 18.7 times greater indoors than out, and less than 10% of Covid-19 infections studied occurred outside. Despite that, several states still have outdoor mask mandates in place."
"Her presence at Biden's side while the verdict was read, and later in the Grand Foyer as each delivered a statement, was the culmination of weeks of private conversations between Biden and Harris about the trial, which officials said had been a subject of increasing concern for the President as he weighed potential outcomes and the prospect of renewed unrest around the country.
More than at any previous point in Biden's presidency so far, the issues of race and policing that had galvanized his presidential campaign were emerging again. The President, his aides and even the first lady watched developments with intense interest, aware a leadership test awaited upon its conclusion.
Biden consulted a wide array of voices about how to respond to a verdict in the Chauvin trial and new incidents of police violence against Black Americans, including members of the Congressional Black Caucus and members of his senior staff, including senior adviser Cedric Richmond and Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice, according to people familiar with the conversations."
"CNN previously reported that US military withdrawal from Afghanistan was underway with equipment being packed and shipped out, according to three defense officials. President Joe Biden announced his decision to end America's longest war earlier this month, arguing that the decades-long conflict no longer aligned with American priorities. The deadline the President has set for troops to withdraw is absolute -- with no potential for an extension based on worsening conditions on the ground.
Miller also said that the US bases in Afghanistan will be given ""primarily"" to the Ministry of Defense and other Afghan forces, as well as some equipment.
""There's certain equipment that we must take back to our countries, that's a requirement,"" he said. ""But wherever possible, if we do not have to, we are looking to ensure that the Afghan security forces have the bases, pieces of equipment, parts that are necessary for the functioning of the military.""
There is concern the drawdown of American troops from Afghanistan could cause the government in Kabul to collapse and the Taliban to return to power.
Gen. Frank McKenzie, commander of US Central Command, which includes the Middle East and Afghanistan, said Thursday that military planners are looking at ways to continue operations in the country following the withdrawal and in the short term bring in ""additional resources"" to support a safe draw down of troops.
Asked about the concern of Taliban violence, Miller said, ""If the Taliban attack, US or any coalition forces, we will have a forceful response if our forces are attacked."" He also said the US would continue to monitor terrorism and would act when ""appropriate.""
Miller said he has spoken with the Taliban Political Commission and that he told them ""a return to violence, an effort to force a military decision, would be a tragedy for Afghanistan and the Afghan people."""
"Sleep plays a vital role in brain function and systemic physiology across many body systems. Problems with sleep are widely prevalent and include deficits in quantity and quality of sleep; sleep problems that impact the continuity of sleep are collectively referred to as sleep disruptions. Numerous factors contribute to sleep disruption, ranging from lifestyle and environmental factors to sleep disorders and other medical conditions. Sleep disruptions have substantial adverse short- and long-term health consequences. A literature search was conducted to provide a nonsystematic review of these health consequences (this review was designed to be nonsystematic to better focus on the topics of interest due to the myriad parameters affected by sleep). Sleep disruption is associated with increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, metabolic effects, changes in circadian rhythms, and proinflammatory responses. In otherwise healthy adults, short-term consequences of sleep disruption include increased stress responsivity, somatic pain, reduced quality of life, emotional distress and mood disorders, and cognitive, memory, and performance deficits. For adolescents, psychosocial health, school performance, and risk-taking behaviors are impacted by sleep disruption. Behavioral problems and cognitive functioning are associated with sleep disruption in children. Long-term consequences of sleep disruption in otherwise healthy individuals include hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, weight-related issues, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and colorectal cancer. All-cause mortality is also increased in men with sleep disturbances. For those with underlying medical conditions, sleep disruption may diminish the health-related quality of life of children and adolescents and may worsen the severity of common gastrointestinal disorders. As a result of the potential consequences of sleep disruption, health care professionals should be cognizant of how managing underlying medical conditions may help to optimize sleep continuity and consider prescribing interventions that minimize sleep disruption."
"In order to better focus on the topics of interest among the myriad parameters affected by sleep, this review of the literature was designed to be nonsystematic. A search of English-language publications in the PubMed database was conducted in March and April 2016. Search terms were “caregiver AND sleep”, “caregiver AND drug administration”, “insomnia”, “middle insomnia”, “restless leg[s] syndrome”, “sleep AND drug administration”, “sleep apnea”, “sleep continuity”, “sleep deprivation”, “sleep disorder”, “sleep disruption”, “sleep disturbance”, “sleep fragmentation”, and “sleep maintenance”. Together, these search terms generated over 60,000 hits. For each individual search, we reviewed the most recent articles to identify those that specifically discussed the consequences of disrupted sleep, rather than those of short sleep duration or other sleep problems. For topics that were not adequately covered by recent literature (previous ~5–10 years), we looked slightly further back in the literature. Other publications were identified by examining the reference lists of publications included in the literature searches. The websites of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, Sleep Research Society, and the European Sleep Research Society were also searched for additional publications. This nonsystematic review pulled information from a total of 97 references."
"Sleep deprivation studies and studies of insomniacs have identified the primary mechanisms by which sleep disruption is believed to exert its detrimental short- and long-term health effects (Figure 1).41–44 During both brief and extended arousals during sleep, increased metabolism is evidenced by increased oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production.43 Levels of catecholamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine have been correlated with fragmented sleep.44 In addition, chronic persistent insomnia is associated with increased secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol, which is present throughout a 24-hour sleep–wake cycle.42 These findings suggest that activations of the sympathetic nervous system, the sympathoadrenal system, and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis are involved in the health consequences of sleep disruption.41–44 In addition, suppression of SWS was associated with decreased insulin sensitivity that did not result in an increase in insulin release; these findings may explain the increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in patients with poor sleep quality.9 Other metabolic changes include decreased leptin and increased ghrelin that may contribute to increased appetite.45 Sleep abnormalities affect immune function in a reciprocal manner, leading to changes in proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukins 1 and 6, and C-reactive protein.12,46 The multitude of systems that react to sleep loss suggest effects beyond the central nervous system and include total body functioning.5"
"Disrupted sleep is a pervasive problem, with numerous contributing factors from lifestyle and environmental factors to psychosocial issues and iatrogenic effects. Sleep is vital to most major physiologic processes, and, as such, sleep disruption has vast potential for adverse short- and long-term health consequences in otherwise healthy individuals as well as those with underlying medical conditions. In healthy individuals, short-term consequences include a heightened stress response; pain; depression; anxiety; and cognition, memory, and performance deficits. In adolescents and children, disrupted sleep can lead to poor school performance and behavior problems. Reduced QoL may be a short-term consequence of sleep disruption in otherwise healthy individuals and those with an underlying medical condition. Long-term consequences for otherwise healthy individuals include hypertension, dyslipidemia, CVD, weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and T2DM. There is also evidence that sleep disruption may increase the risk of certain cancers and death in males and suicidal adolescents. Long-term sleep disruption may also worsen the symptoms of a variety of gastrointestinal disorders.

Ultimately, it has been suggested that the physiologic consequences of disrupted sleep may be just as damaging as those of short sleep duration.5 Given the detrimental impact of disrupted sleep, it is important for health care professionals to effectively treat symptoms of underlying medical conditions to optimize sleep continuity. In addition, when possible, health care providers should consider prescribing interventions that minimize disruptions to sleep continuity,25 such as medications with a long dosing interval."
"Exercise has long been associated with better sleep, and evidence is accumulating on the efficacy of exercise as a nonpharmacologic treatment option for disturbed sleep. Recent research, however, has noted that poor sleep may contribute to low physical activity levels, emphasizing a robust bidirectional relationship between exercise and sleep. This article will briefly review the evidence supporting the use of exercise as a nonpharmacologic treatment for sleep disturbance, outline future research that is needed to establish the viability of exercise as a behavioral sleep treatment, describe recent research that has emphasized the potential influence of poor sleep on daytime activity levels, and discuss whether improving sleep may facilitate adoption and/or better adherence to a physically active lifestyle. With poor sleep and physical inactivity each recognized as key public health priorities, additional research into the bidirectional relationship between exercise and sleep has significant implications for facilitating greater exercise adherence and improving sleep in society."
"Sufficient sleep is essential for optimum health—just a few of the numerous processes occurring during sleep include memory consolidation, clearance of brain metabolites, and restoration of nervous, immune, skeletal, and muscular systems.1 Virtually all bodily systems are impacted by poor or inadequate sleep, and chronic sleep disturbance predisposes an individual to cardiovascular disease, metabolic dysfunction, psychiatric disorders, and early mortality.1,2

Despite the significance of adequate sleep, insufficient or disturbed sleep is extremely common. For instance, thirty percent of employed adults report obtaining 6 or fewer hours of sleep per night,3 approximately one-third of all adults report significant sleep complaints,4 and the two most common sleep disorders, insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), each have prevalence rates exceeding 10% in the adult population.5,6 Unfortunately, current approaches to treatment are limited. For poor sleep quality and insomnia complaints, prescription hypnotic medications offer short-term efficacy but are plagued by concerns about dependency, hazardous side effects, and long-term health risk.7 In contrast, cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) provides greater long-term efficacy and fewer side effects than hypnotics; however, availability remains restricted.8 Meanwhile, the primary treatment option for SDB, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), significantly reduces SDB symptoms when used, but compliance remains problematic.9"
"Exercise has long been associated with better sleep.11 Despite surprisingly little experimental research involving patients with significant sleep disturbance or sleep disorders, the available evidence suggests that exercise holds promise as a nonpharmacologic therapy for adults with poor or disordered sleep.10

Most studies that have examined the effects of exercise training on general poor sleep quality (i.e., subclinical sleep complaints) have focused on older adults, among whom sleep complaints are extremely prevalent. A recent meta-analysis of six studies found that exercise training resulted in modest improvements in subjective sleep quality in middle- to older-aged adults with sleep problems.12 However, other trials have found minimal to no improvements in sleep following exercise training (e.g., 13) and objective sleep parameters have rarely been found to change in the few trials that have utilized actigraphy or polysomnography.14,15 Although there are only three published studies to date, research that has focused on adults diagnosed with chronic insomnia have provided much more consistent—and promising—results on the effect of exercise on sleep.16-18 As a prominent example, Reid and colleagues found that 4 months of aerobic exercise training in a sample of older adults with insomnia significantly improved sleep quality while also reducing daytime sleepiness and depressive symptoms.17 Thus, exercise may hold the most promise for those with more severe or more chronic sleep disturbance.

Exercise training also reduces SDB severity, with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) the most common type of SDB examined. A recent meta-analysis of five studies found that exercise training reduced OSA severity by 32% despite a nonsignificant decrease in body mass index(BMI). 19 In the largest randomized trial to date, Kline and colleagues found that 12 weeks of moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance exercise resulted in a 25% reduction in OSA severity despite less than 1 kg of weight loss.20 Notably, exercise training also led to better subjective and objective sleep and improvements in daytime functioning (e.g., quality of life, depressive symptoms, vigor, fatigue) in this sample.21"
"Overall, the available evidence certainly suggests that exercise could be a valuable behavioral therapy for poor or disordered sleep. However, many unanswered questions need resolved before exercise can be optimally prescribed as a behavioral treatment option for disturbed sleep. Perhaps the most pressing need is for larger-scale experimental studies to be conducted as, for both insomnia/poor sleep quality and SDB, the current evidence base is too small to provide well-informed recommendations. For instance, recent meta-analyses summarizing the effect of exercise training on subjective sleep quality and OSA severity included only 305 (6 trials) and 129 participants (5 trials), respectively.12,19 Larger sample sizes will also allow researchers to examine whether specific participant characteristics can predict the efficacy of exercise on sleep outcomes; while most studies have found that exercise, on average, modestly improves sleep parameters and OSA severity, it is plausible that individuals will respond differently depending upon specific attributes (e.g., sex, BMI, depressive symptoms).25

Little attention has been given to the possibility that the various components of an exercise regimen (e.g., dose, mode, timing) have differential effects on sleep. Experimental studies have typically employed moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or moderate-intensity resistance exercise at doses that approximate public health guidelines; however, direct comparisons between different exercise intensities have not been performed, and combining or directly comparing modes of exercise have been rare.20,26 There has also been minimal inquiry into the possible dose-response effects of exercise on sleep27,28—for instance, is there a minimal dose of exercise (integrating frequency, duration, and intensity) below which sleep is not improved? Conversely, are greater improvements in sleep observed with higher doses of exercise? Likewise, the time course of change in sleep with exercise is relatively unknown, as most studies have only examined sleep at baseline and post-intervention. Whether the timing of exercise matters in relation to sleep has received the most attention thus far, primarily due to the alleged sleep-disrupting effect of late-night exercise. While the optimal time of exercise for sleep remains equivocal,13,18 experimental evidence does not support the claim that late-night exercise disrupts subsequent sleep.29"
"The observational studies noted above allow the possibility that improving sleep may increase daytime activity levels. This is a logical supposition, as sleep and physical activity are both modifiable behaviors, and better sleep—by minimizing daytime impairment (e.g., sleepiness, fatigue/energy)—could facilitate an active lifestyle. However, experimental evidence to support this possibility is lacking. To my knowledge, only one study has examined this question in adults with poor sleep and/or insomnia. In a sample of older adults diagnosed with chronic insomnia, Kline and colleagues found that 4 weeks of behavioral treatment for insomnia did not change either self-reported or actigraphic measures of daytime activity despite significant improvements in subjective and actigraphic sleep at post-intervention.49

Similar results have been found in the three studies that have examined whether CPAP treatment increases daytime activity levels in patients with OSA. Across these studies, 1-6 months of CPAP treatment had no discernible impact on objective measures of physical activity despite significant improvement in daytime impairment (e.g., sleepiness, fatigue).50-52 Moreover, a recent study found that an intervention combining CPAP with tailored behavioral modification of eating habits and physical activity successfully improved eating behavior but was unable to change physical activity levels.53

The disappointing results of these studies—in particular, those involving OSA patients—suggest that improving sleep is insufficient to spontaneously change physical activity behavior. Traditional sleep treatments may need to be augmented with focused physical activity counseling to change activity levels in adults with poor sleep. Furthermore, identification of the specific barriers and facilitators to altering physical activity behavior in adults with disturbed sleep may be helpful. Although this has not been evaluated in adults with poor sleep quality or insomnia, studies focused on OSA patients have found that physical activity levels correspond to patients' stage of behavior change readiness54 and fear of movement.55"
"There are many benefits to exercising regularly2. These include a lower risk of diseases like cancer and diabetes, improved physical function, and a higher quality of life. Exercising can also benefit certain groups. For example, pregnant women who engage in routine physical activity are less likely to gain an excessive amount of weight or experience postpartum depression, and elderly people who exercise are at lower risk of being injured during a fall.

Exercising also improves sleep for many people. Specifically, moderate-to-vigorous exercise can increase sleep quality for adults by reducing sleep onset – or the time it takes to fall asleep – and decrease the amount of time they lie awake in bed during the night. Additionally, physical activity can help alleviate daytime sleepiness and, for some people, reduce the need for sleep medications.

Exercise can also improve sleep in indirect ways. For instance, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity can decrease the risk of excessive weight gain, which in turn makes that person less likely to experience symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Roughly 60% of moderate to severe OSA cases3 have been attributed to obesity."
"The US is expected to have a surplus of vaccines in the hundreds of millions of doses. Some of those doses have already been sent to Mexico and Canada as part of what the US has referred to as a ""loan."" Psaki would not say on Monday whether the US would distribute its additional trove of AstraZeneca vaccines to the international community on a loan or gifted basis.
The US has taken initial steps to help other countries ramp up vaccinations, including by boosting global manufacturing and appointing Gayle Smith, a former director of the US Agency for International Development, to coordinate the international response to the coronavirus pandemic.
But ""vaccine diplomacy"" has been sharply limited by concerns among Biden administration officials that unforeseen factors may necessitate a stockpile of doses, including requiring boosters, the spread of variants, and the still-uncertain nature of which vaccine works best among children.
Political concerns have also weighed on officials, who are wary of sending doses abroad before every American can access them.
So far, nearly 54% of adults in the US have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, according to data published Monday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Biden said in March that if there was a surplus of vaccines, ""we're going to share it with the rest of the world."" However, he has repeatedly underscored that vaccines will not be sent without taking care of the American population first."
"When Biden took office, the US was averaging around 195,000 new cases of Covid-19 a day and 3,000 deaths. Now there are signs the pandemic is easing, with an average around 57,000 fresh infections and nearly 700 deaths per day.
Those numbers are still dangerously high, but Biden's claims reflect a strategy that under-promised and over delivered on vaccinations, while his administration benefited from taking power at a dark moment in the pandemic that his predecessor had largely neglected. The President also had the good fortune to inherit an effective vaccine development program from Trump, though his team argues that the previous administration had few plans to distribute it.
But through his own management and a measure of luck, Biden will address a nation emerging from a viral storm in a more sustainable way than it ever has since the start of the pandemic.
Timing of the address is no coincidence
It's no coincidence that Biden's first address to Congress -- an occasion shorn of much of its ceremony by social distancing -- will take place later than those of most modern first-term presidents seeking a boost to their agendas.
""He wanted to make sure that the coronavirus pandemic and economic legislation had passed Congress. He wanted to make sure that the $1,400 checks that were sent were received by the public,"" said Aaron Kall, director of the debate program at the University of Michigan and editor of ""Mr. Speaker, The President of the United States,"" about presidential addresses to Congress. ""The timing was definitely by design.""
Polling as the end of Biden's first symbolic 100 days approaches suggests public satisfaction with how the new President seized control of the pandemic. An average of the six most recently conducted surveys shows 55% of Americans approve of the way he is handling his job while 41% disapprove."
